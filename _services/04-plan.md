> "Emergency planning and decision making has never been more essential in the protection of so
many at one time. Leaders now pressed into being disaster managers need to quickly adapt their
methods of leadership. With a real threat that the disease will have a second or third wave, we
need to immediately begin contingency planning while still providing daily operational planning
and decision making." --[*Homeland Security Today*][1]
