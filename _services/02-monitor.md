We are developing technology to monitor employee health, air quality, and surface contamination
at work.

- On-entry temperature screening
- Training and supplies
- Online dashboard for integrated reporting and analytics
- Automated alerts
- Meet and exceed CDC guidelines

> Because the CDC and state/local health authorities have acknowledged community spread of
COVID-19 and issued attendant precautions as of March 2020, employers may measure employees'
body temperature. -- [*US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission*][1]
